## Introduction
This repository contains my cumulative course project in Dr. Andreas Handel's Modern Applied Data Analysis course at the University of Georgia in spring 2024. The project was designed to include all the different components of a data analysis covered in the course:

Finding a good data
Getting the data
Cleaning the data
Exploring the data
Processing the data
Analyzing the data
Reporting/communicating your findings
Doing everything reproducibly


## Project Topic
This brings us to the actual project contained within this repository: CASE DETECTION OF TUBERCULOSIS PATIENTS USING MACHINE-LEARNING

## Requirements for Reproduction
This analysis requires R, Rmarkdown, quarto (and variants, e.g. bookdown), Github and a reference manager that can handle bibtex (e.g. Zotero). It also requires a word processor to be installed (e.g. MS Word or LibreOffice). It is beneficial to have a spreadsheet processor installed (e.g. MS Excel or LibreOffice) to read the data and dictionaries.

## Repository Structure
All data are in the subfolders inside the data folder.
All code is in the subfolders inside the code folder.
All results (figures, tables) are in results folder.
All products (manuscripts, supplement)are in products subfolders.
See the various readme.md files in those folders for some more information.

## Project Content
The original data are located in the raw_data folder.
The processing_code folder contains the quarto files required for processing the data, which are then saved in the processed_data folder.
The analysis_code folder contains the quarto files that address the research questions for this study. They produce figures and tables
The products folder contains the bibtex and CSL style file for references, which are used by the manuscript.
The products/manuscript folder contains the report written in quarto.
The products/supplement folder contains the supplemental material for the manuscript.
The reviews folder contains classmate reviews.
